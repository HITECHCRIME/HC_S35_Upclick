(It's a) second pass - reckon swerving round triple -
feelin' thrill - like I'm living a life
click click click shot up to the social spheres
mind goes alight, mind goes alight.
total blinds, share share share (share)?
i'm not alone yet feeling' scared
routing signals from end to end
fake windows (your) only friends

[BRIDGE]
damn roll honey
not invited ain't
awoke again (interconnect?)(triggering?) (among sleepers) all
cock and moe (ey)

[CHORUS]
this so for ya, 
fucking dope yeah (hope?)
all the praised nights
what ya lookin' for is
upclick

upclick
viewers tell me if i'm un-fit
standing at the abyss
would you jump it x2

[VERSE 2]
losing constant flight in the sky 
I miss the times - when I thought I was alive
holding my breath for days to check, wanna
know how it feels to spot a break your trend
feel the burn of an upclick
tapping the button and still going public (pressing the buttons launching from orbit)
so don't drop it, going after the swatches, 
not long, people to  up it and up it
getting the profit
snatching that profit
rising above it


[BRIDGE]
damn roll honey
not invited ain't
awoke again (interconnect?)(triggering?) (among sleepers) all
cock and moe (ey)

[CHORUS]
this so for ya, 
fucking dope yeah (hope?)
all the praised nights
what ya lookin' for is
upclick

likes, hearts, souls and mojis - on screen / copy, paste, edit, share
attention coded minds - craves sick 
your own loop, your own kind - play this -
into your own thought games that you've made it

--

tell yourself
i made it x5

well just end the spread, (meant to end) - i don't care
cast your face like most nights
we'll be done and you'll be fair
once your reach your regular  reign 

Big campaigns (?) not sharing the profits
Mind the gap between virtual and real
The options are there, so are the stakes
i hope you get it's unreal
 
nothing more than a veil too thin
into you at the origin_



blue whale sticking the cause
ripping the fuzz, ey cuz
whatcha doing online
this is fine, this allright
i won't rat you out but you're mine

SPITRAP
feelin' the burn like a champ
making churn ye
what's good what's with ye
looking for a helping hand?



honesty swirling down the drain

wish the upclick would end
x

and so please
