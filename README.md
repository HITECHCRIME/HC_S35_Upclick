[VERSE 1]
(It's a) second pass - reckon swerving round triple -
Feelin' thrill - like I'm living a life
Click click click shot up to social spheres
Mind goes alight, mind goes alight.
Total blinds, share share share share
I'm not alone yet feeling' scared
routing signals from end to end 
fake windows (your) only friends 

when will it end, i don't care
once your reach regular your reign will be done

wishing the upclick would end
x
x
and so please


[BRIDGE]
Roll honey
not invited ain't
awoke again (interconnect?)(triggering?) (among sleepers) all
cock and moe (ey)

[CHORUS]
this so for ya, 
fucking dope yeah (hope?)
all the praised nights
what ya lookin' for is
upclick

SPITRAP
feelin' the burn like a champ
making it churn 
what's good what's with ye
looking for a helping hand?

[VERSE 2]

fucking name
that's right poke me

I miss the times
When I thought I was alive
losing my constant flight in the sky 
Holding my breath for days to check, 
how it feels to spot a break in your neck
Feel the burn of upclick
Pressing the buttons coz I'm feeling like wacko
Going after the swatches, not long and people up it
Big campaigns (?) not sharing the profits
Mind the gap between virtual and real
The options are there, so are the stakes

likes, hearts, souls and mojis on screen
amount to nothing more than a veil too thin
your own loop your own kind craves
attention coded minds / into you at the origin_
coded into your own mind

[BRIDGE]
Roll honey
not invited ain't
awoke again (interconnect?)(triggering?) (among sleepers) all
cock and moe (ey)

[CHORUS]
this so for ya, 
fucking dope yeah (hope?)
all the praised nights
what ya lookin' for is
upclick
