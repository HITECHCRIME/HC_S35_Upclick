[VERSE 1]
(It's a) second pass - reckon swerving round triple -
feelin' thrill - like I'm living a life
click click click shot up to the social spheres
mind goes alight, mind goes alight.
total blinds, share share share (share)?
i'm not alone yet feeling' scared
routing signals from end to end
fake windows (your) only friends 

[BRIDGE]
damn roll honey
not invited ain't
awoke again (interconnect?)(triggering?) (among sleepers) all
cock and moe (ey)

[CHORUS]
this so for ya, 
fucking dope yeah (hope?)
all the praised nights
what ya lookin' for is
upclick

upclick
viewers tell me if i'm un-fit
standing at the abyss
would you jump it

SPITRAP
feelin' the burn like a champ
making churn ye
what's good what's with ye
looking for a helping hand?

well just end the spread, (meant to end) - i don't care
once your reach regular your reign 
cast your face like most nights
we'll be done and you'll be fair

honesty swirling down the drain

wish the upclick would end

and so please

[VERSE 2]

fucking name
that's right poke me

I miss the times
When I thought I was alive
losing my constant flight in the sky 
Holding my breath for days to check, 
how it feels to spot a break your neck
Feel the burn of an upclick
Pressing the buttons launching from orbit
Going after the swatches, not long and people up it and up it

Big campaigns (?) not sharing the profits
Mind the gap between virtual and real
The options are there, so are the stakes

likes, hearts, souls and mojis on screen
amount to nothing more than a veil too thin
your own loop your own kind craves
attention coded minds / into you at the origin_
coded into your own mind

blue whale sticking the cause
ripping the fuzz, ey cuz
whatcha doing online
this is fine, this allright
i won't rat you out but you're mine

[BRIDGE]
Roll honey
not invited ain't
awoke again (interconnect?)(triggering?) (among sleepers) all
cock and moe (ey)

[CHORUS]
this so for ya, 
fucking dope yeah (hope?)
all the praised nights
what ya lookin' for is
upclick
