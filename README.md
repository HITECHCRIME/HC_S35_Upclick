[VERSE 1]
Second pass reckon swerving round triple
Feelin' thrill like I'm living a life
Click click click shot up to social spheres
Mind goes alight, mind goes alight.
Total blinds, share share share
I'm not alone yet feeling' scared
Routing signals from end to end, 
Fake windows only friends, 
wishing the upclick would end


spitrap here

[VERSE 2]
I miss the times
When I thought I was alive
losing my flight in the sky 
Holding my breath for days to check, 
how it feels to spot a break in your neck
Feel the burn of upclick
Pressing the buttons coz I'm feeling like wacko
Going after the swatches, not long and people up it
Big campaigns (?) not sharing the profits
Mind the gap between virtual and real
The options are there, so are the stakes

likes, hearts, souls and mojis on screen
amount to nothing more than a veil too thin
your own loop your own kind craves
attention coded into you at the origin_
coded into your own mind
